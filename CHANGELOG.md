I made some mistakes. Yes, you can put my head on a stick for this. This patch aims to fix those stinky bugs we left in after v1.0.0's release, and nothing more.

• Saxashitter
	• Fixed hooks.lua syntax error. I accessed the wrong events thing.
	• Experimental fix for a strangr issue that occurred recently, making a player not attached to a team. This fix is experimental, but it could still happen. If you are alresdy in a Trios team that doesn't meet the 3 player limit, but isn't a solo team, there won't be any players added into your team.
	• Patch Discord link to direct to the new official Heist server instead of my community server.
	• Bump version number. Accidentally left it as "Beta". Whoops.

If there are any bugs, be sure to report them to me within the official Fang's Heist Discord.
That's all now, take care!
