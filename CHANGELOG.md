I'm going to admit. I don't feel proud of Heist. The mod has been heavily altered due to criticism, and as much as I tried to please both collectathon and PvP enjoyers, nothing I did cut it. This update aims to make my mod truly mine, while improving some aspects of other things, including movesets.

So, it may look like I'm making up words, but I genuinely think calling this a "mechanical refresh" is the best way to go about it. It's like turning off Fang's Heist and turning it on again. The difference is night and day, and I do believe that these changes will make the mod more straight-forward and more fun to play. Of course, some people won't prefer this, but it'll be too hard to try and keep going with the old gameplay style I wanted to go for. It felt like there was too much to it.

• Saxashitter:
	• The Sign now gives $5000 instead of $600, basically guaranteeing a win
	• Treasures now give $5000 / Amount of treasures inside the map, so that means treasures act as fragments to a second sign.
	• The profit variable when you define a Carriable can now accept functions for it's profit gain.
	• Players now have a health percentage, which displays on top of their heads if you are close to them.
	• PVP now works similar to Smash. If you hit a wall when you are over 100%, you will die.
	• FangsHeist.DrawString now caches font widths, making the mod only run width-getting functions once. This optimizes the mod a ton.
