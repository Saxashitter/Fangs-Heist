I'm going to admit. I don't feel proud of Heist. The mod has been heavily altered due to criticism, and as much as I tried to please both collectathon and PvP enjoyers, nothing I did cut it. This update aims to make my mod truly mine, while improving some aspects of other things, including movesets.

So, it may look like I'm making up words, but I genuinely think calling this a "mechanical refresh" is the best way to go about it. It's like turning off Fang's Heist and turning it on again. The difference is night and day, and I do believe that these changes will make the mod easier and more fun to play.

• Saxashitter:
	• The Sign now gives $5000 instead of $600, basically guaranteeing a win
	• Treasures now give $5000 / Amount of treasures inside the map, so that means treasures act as fragments to a second sign.
	• The profit variable when you define a Carriable can now accept functions for it's profit gain.
